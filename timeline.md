# Project Timeline

The following checkpoints are meant to serve as general guidelines for how you should spend your time over the next week. 

## Phase I - Exploration
### Wednesday, February 26 thru Thursday, February 27
During this phase, you are in ideation and exploration mode. You and your partner should be exploring different ideas and then evaluating the feasibility of those ideas based on the APIs, datasets, and skills that your currently have available to you.
#### Output
At the end of this phase, you will submit your [project proposal](https://forms.gle/27qCW9tHQVeNB7gh6). I will sit down with each group to discuss the rigor and feasibility of your project after this is submitted.

## Phase II - Data Modeling
### Friday, February 28 thru Monday, March 2
The goal of this phase is to build out your _models_, or the classes and functions that your will use to fetch, manipulate, and derive insights from the data that powers your application. You are knee deep in documentation. You are testing out SDKs. **You are writing tests to ensure future changes do not break your application.** Then, ultimately, you are building a working version of your app in the browser console.
#### Output
By the end of this phase, you have a working "command line application". Meaning you should be able to load your JavaScript files into the browser, call the functions that fetch and manipulate data, and they should return well-formatted data that you could easily be displayed in the DOM.


## Phase III - Building a UI
### Tuesday, March 3
During this phase, you will build out a clean and intuitive UI. Your goal is to build an app that _works_. Don't be cute here, be smart. Be intentional. Be efficient. Don't be afraid to lean on a CSS framework to get some clean styling out of the box. Lastly, test your UI. Try to break your application by clicking around like an erratic use. Ensure that your app is dummy proof.
#### Output
You will ship version 0 of your app. By the end of the day on Tuesday, you should be able to give Maya your application and she should be able to use it and derive value from it.

## Phase IV - Revise, Improve, and Document Your Process
### Wednesday, March 4
Here, you can be cute. You can implement that UI feature that is a "nice-to-have" but not a "need-to-have." You can pull in data from that extra API that you have been sitting on. You will make your UI more visually appealing. Additionally, you will prepare to tell the story of your app and your journey to building it.
#### Output
Final Project + Presentation on 10AM on Thursday, March 5
